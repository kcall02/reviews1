         <p>Halo:Combat Evolved</p>
         <p class="red">The very first game I will be giving my opinion on is the game known world wide as Halo. This game is tied to so many different things such as shows, movies, toys, and much more. What I will be talking about is the first game in a long series.
            Our character that we play as in the campaign, Master Chief also known as John 117. He is known as a Spartan. A group of renowned space marine that fights for the fate of humanity against the main antagonists of the game called, the Covenant. Which are a group of different aliens that aim to kill every human on earth or so we think.
            I won't say to much on the story so I don't spoil anything for anyone who wishes to play it in the future. Halo: Combat Evolved came out on Novembner 15, 2001, and is a first person shooter game which was developed by Bungie and published by Microsoft for the console Xbox. That featured a campaign storymode that the player
            could go through. Learning just what is at stake for humanity. If the player wanted to have another person play with them they could do so by hooking up another controler and play split screen Co-op. Personally I really liked getting to play this game and experiance what one of the most popular shooters was back in the day.
            Getting the chance to also play this with my little brother was really nice to do split screen game play. Now for the game it self, it was amazing for a game that released in 2001. For a game that is over 20 years old its gprahics were amazing by those standards and the gameplay was amazing, If you didn't wannt to just rush into battle
            spraying bullets you could sit back and shoot from affar.  Or if you wanted to just support your team you could by driving the vehicles. This game had multiple ways of playing that could cater to many many people which opened it up to having a large number of players. I will say for the multiplayer it was a bit lack luster with the 
            customization. Keeping us in either red or blue clothing to signify which team was which but I understand it was only 2001 after all. To some up my review this was a beautiful game with long hours of gameplay. With an amazing storyline.  Once I was finished I could still play it with my family and friends. Personally I will definitely stick with
            the newer games that the Halo franchise produced. 9/10

         <p>Pokemon:Crystal</p>
         <p class="blue">Now the Pokemon franchise has spread far and wide with moives, shows, cardgames, and much more. Pokemon was made by a japanese game designer named Satoshi Tajiri and with the help of Nintendo pokemon was born. The specific game that I will be reveiwing is Pokemon Crystal. This game is the 2nd generation of pokemon following Pokemon Red, Blue and yellow. 
            Generation 2 inculdes Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal. The game play for each is basically the same with catching and leveling your team to beat gyms and the antagonists of the game. This game has had a few different release dates with Japans being December 14, 2000.  North America was on July 29, 2001 and Europe was on November 2, 2001. 
            In pokemon games you start off your journey by receiving 1 of the three starter pokemon that you can choose from. After doing a small errand for a proffessor you will begin your journey. There are quite a few things to do in this game but to keep it simple all I did was the most basic of things by catching pokemon I thought would be good picks for my team. 
            For pokemon its like rock, paper, scissors, with a pokemons type having more power over anothers. So, I sought types that would give a good balance for my team. There are 17 types in pokemon, such as, Bug, dark, Dragon, electric, fighting, fire, flying, ghost, grass, ground, ice, normal, poison, psychic, rock, steel, and water. Dark and Steel are brand new types with the 2nd generation. 
            Now once you build your team you can battle other pokemon trainers to level your team or go out into the wilds and fight other wild pokemon. To either catch or defeat for experiance points. In pokemon you have a few goals you can shoot for with either catching all the pokemon this generation has to offer, defeat every gym leader, take on the pokemon league, and defeat the main villans of the story. 
            Catching every pokemon is impossible due to some pokemon being locked to just one game. So you would have to trade with friends to get the ones you were missing. Beating the Gyms is the main thing people do because its what locks most of the story progression. There are 16 gym leaders in total, each much harder to fight than the last. 
            Each gym leader follows 1 pokemon type. They base their gym on a singular type.  So if they are a high level you can still win with the right type of match up. After you get all 8 gym badges for your starter location the Johto region you can move onto the Elite four. These four trainers are the toughest and strongest out of all the region. What lies beyond them? You will have to find that out your self. 
            One thing that I did dislike about the game is that some battles have giant level leaps which sometimes made me feel like my whole progression of the game was worth nothing but it also made me want to play more to show that my team and I could beat them all. 
            All around Pokemon Crystal is a giant leap from the first generation, with many more pokemon being added, a couple new types, new items to get and much much more. The story itself that the player goes through isn't all that special 
            but it is definitely a shock for people who have played the first generation with the stories being tied to one another. One of my most favorite generations I have ever had the pleasure of playing with many many secrets to find. 8/10

         <p>Dragon Ball Z:Kakaro</p>
         <p class="green">Compared to other games I have reveiwed this is one of the newer games by far with its release date being on January 16, 2020. This game being Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot with some people also calling it Project Z. In my opinion this is the best Dragon Ball game I have ever played. The graphics are absolutely beautiful and does the story justice. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot
            Follows along with the story of Dragon Ball Z with Goku and his friends, family, and rivals going through battle after battle of the story. The creator of the Story Dragon Ball Z is a japanese manga writer Akira Toriyama, he has made many stories but his most notable series Dragon Ball. This game follows from the very first episode of Dragon Ball Z. It even includes DLC
            for the movies and specials as well. Each episode of Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot you play as one of the main characters. As this character you are able to do quite a few things while in between episodes such as train, look for materials, fish, do sub stories and much more. For the sake of keeping the reveiw short and to the point I followed the story as best I could to give an
            accurate description of the game. In the game you follow the life of Goku also known as Kakarot. In the start of the game we are given a breif tutorial of what the game will be consisting of, and that is fighting. There are many moves we can unlock and upgrade to help us in battle. Some are locked behind the story itself and to get them you need to progress, which luckily is 
            quite fun. After I had finished the tutorial I was able to explore a bit and see just how giant the map for this game is. The map I saw was one of many. Exploration is highly suggested to help find things that could help you throughout your gameplay. At first it was a bit overwelling to see just how giant of a map it was but luckily as I played and got used to the manovering
            it was very easy and really fun to traverse the map. In the game there are many NPC's that will give you items and information or just sometimes random speaches that go along with the story. To me that made me realize just how alive this world is. Seeing each and every NPC or mob move around the game to see how real it is for the character. As I progressed through the game 
            I realized I wasn't locked to just 1 character. I found that I was able to play as 7 different people. Some were locked behind progression but it was interesting to see how playing as a different character made other NPC's say and give different sets of text. All around this game is absolutely amazing for long term and even new Dragon Ball fans. It is a dream come true to get to see
            our heros story. Such amazing graphics and to see what there lives are like even when they aren't having to fight day in and day out. There is so much story to this game and with the DLC that widens the gameplay even more but even if you don't get them it is still a game worth pouring hours into discovering every thing you can. 8/10
